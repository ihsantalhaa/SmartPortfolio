# Smart Portfolio
## .NetCore MVC - Decision Support Project
This project is a decision support system that provides portfolio management and optimization, analyzing the graphs of selected stocks on Borsa Istanbul using fuzzy logic and linear regression methods.
You can access the API application designed for the project through my friend Can's GitHub account.
